# topic-classification

Text classification model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling.

## Introduction

Roughly speaking, topic modeling allows us to establish relationships between documents based on the co-occurrence of terms or expressions (i.e., tokens). Such relationships allow for the discrimination of many documents into multiple latent groups (or topics) so that documents contained in the same group share some kind of meaning somehow.

Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning process, meaning that no labeled data is required. However, we can benefit from using labeled data by attempting to build a classifier in a semi-supervised fashion.
